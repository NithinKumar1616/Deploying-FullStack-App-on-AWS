Domain Name Integration

Purchased a domain name and created a hosted zone in AWS Route 53.

Added the Name Server (NS) records to Hostinger to link the domain with Route 53.

Created individual DNS records for the IP addresses of the backend, database, and frontend servers.

Updated the project: Deploying a Full-Stack Application Using EC2 Instances: A Step-by-Step Guide to replace IP addresses with the new domain hostnames for cleaner and more manageable access
